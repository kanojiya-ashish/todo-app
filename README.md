# 📝 To-Do List App (Python)

A simple command-line based To-Do List application made using **Python** and **file handling**.  
This project helps users add, view, and delete their daily tasks, and stores everything in a local text file.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add tasks to a list
- 👀 View all saved tasks
- ❌ Delete specific tasks by number
- 💾 Tasks are stored in `todo.txt` file for persistence
- 🔒 Handles file-not-found errors gracefully

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Tasks are stored line-by-line in a file named `todo.txt`
- The app keeps running in a loop until the user chooses to exit
